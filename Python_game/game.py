#Theory behind the project 
#Online game development with Python 
#sockets and networking to connect clients and server to connect what is know
#as client or server or multiple clients to a server where they can send and
#share information where they can send and share information and therefore 
#we can create an online game. Massive amounts of info to the server and back
#to the client. Start simply by getting eveything working on our local
#network and then go ahead and deploy it on an external server which will
#allow us to play from anywhere in the world and not just against people on
#our local network
